    <p>An app to manage shared vehicles across your organisation. </p>

    <p>Unlike the Fleet app which is concerned with assigning vehicles to specific drivers and managing the servicing etc. this app enables the tracking of shared vehicles, recording individual trips made, and booking vehicles ahead of time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recording trips, start time, finish time, start odometer, end odometer, who was driving, purpose of the trip</li>
        <li>Booking vechiles in advance</li>
        <li>Differentiate between business and private use</li>
        <li>Setting an employee's preferred vehicle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Assume your business receives a traffic infringement notice, you will quickly be able to see who was driving that vehicle at that time!</p>
